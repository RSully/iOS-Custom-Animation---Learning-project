## Idea

The point of this project is to show an iPhone application with a relatively simple concept be built and work, from day 1 to app-store ready.

I built this program to show a friend the "basics" (isn't really turning out that way) of Objective-C and to jump him into some development beyond the scope of his book and tutorials.
