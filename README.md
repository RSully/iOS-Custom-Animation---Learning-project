Custom animation via tap-events. iOS project. 

## Idea

The point of this project is to show an iPhone application with a relatively simple concept be built and work, from day 1 to app-store ready.

I built this program to show a friend the "basics" (isn't really turning out that way) of Objective-C and to jump him into some development beyond the scope of his book and tutorials.



## App store

When the game is finished we will be placing it in the app-store for all to play. We ask that you do not submit it to the app store as your own work - we would be very upset if we saw that. This project is meant to show you what's possible and give you a good timeframe refernece (via commit logs). 


### Open-source

This project is open-source on an AS-IS basis. We'd love for you to fork us and show us what modifications you'd like added. Again, please do not submit this to the app store, we'd hate to see dozens of copies of almost the same game end up in there.
